## Challenges and Badges

### Purpose
Challenges exist to encourage consistent practice, skill improvement, and community engagement.
Badges provide optional public recognition for achievements, while achievements track progress privately and system-wide.

### Challenges
- A challenge is a structured activity with defined rules and a completion condition.
- Challenges may be time-bound or ongoing.
- Challenges may be individual or competitive.
- Some challenges may require a symbolic entry fee.

### Achievements
- Achievements are earned automatically when a challenge or milestone is completed.
- Achievements are permanent and stored on the user’s profile.
- Achievements may be used internally progress tracking.
- Not all achievements result in badges.

### Badges
- Badges are visual representations of select achievements.
- Users may choose whether to display badges on their profile.
- Badges have no functional impact beyond visibility and recognition.

### Challenge Participation
- Users may join challenges that are open and active.
- Some challenges may require a symbolic entry fee.
- Users may leave a challenge after joining.
- If a user leaves a challenge, they are treated as if they never joined and receive no rewards or recognition.
- Users can only join a challenge once unless the challenge is explicitly marked as repeatable.
- Once a challenge has started, users cannot join late unless explicitly allowed.

### Challenge Completion
- Challenge completion is determined based on the rules defined for each challenge.
- Challenges may require system-tracked actions, manual submissions, or a combination of both.
- Completion criteria are validated before any rewards are issued.
- Partial completion does not grant achievements or badges unless explicitly defined.

### Rewards
- Non-monetary rewards (achievements, badges, points) are assigned automatically by the system.
- Monetary rewards are not distributed automatically and require manual handling.

### Repeatable Challenges and Streaks
- Some challenges are repeatable, while others are one-time only.
- Repeatable challenges may track streaks or cumulative progress.
- Longer or sustained streaks may unlock higher-tier achievements or badges.
- The same challenge may grant different achievements based on progress level.

## Championships

### Overview
Championships are competitive, time-bound challenges with defined rules and rewards.
There may be either official platform championships or community-hosted championships.

### Championship Types
### Platform Championships
- Created and managed by the platform.
- The platform is responsible for rules, entry fees, scoring, and rewards.
- Championships always produce at least one winner.

### Community-Hosted Championships
- Hosted by tutors within their own communities.
- The platform is not responsible for rules, fees, scoring, or rewards.
- Community-hosted championships must clearly indicate that they are not platform-sponsored.

### Entry
- Users may enroll in championships by paying a symbolic entry fee.
- Entry fees are collected before the championship starts.
- Users may withdraw before the championship start time.
- If a user withdraws before the championship start time, the entry fee is refunded.
- If a user leaves after the championship has started, the entry fee is not refunded.

### Participation Rules
- Championships have a fixed start and end time.
- Late entry is not allowed.
- Leaving a championship after it starts disqualifies the user from winning.

### Winner Determination
- Championships must define winner selection criteria in advance.
- Championships always have at least one winner.
- Scoring may be automated, manual, or a combination of both.
- Tie-breaking rules must be defined per championship.

### Rewards
- Non-monetary rewards are assigned automatically by the system.
- Monetary rewards are handled manually.
- Rewards are distributed only after championship completion.

### Disputes
- Participation logs, submissions, and scoring records are used to resolve disputes.
- For community-hosted championships, disputes are handled by the host, not the platform.
